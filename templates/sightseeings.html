            <h2><a href="https://www.esmadrid.com/informacion-turistica/la-gran-via" target="_blank">1. Gran Vía</a></h2>
            <p>The main tourist and shopping artery in the centre of the capital starts at C/Alcalá and runs 
               1.3 kilometres to its end at Plaza de España. Throughout over 100 years, Gran Vía has had various
               names depending on the incumbent government. During the Spanish Civil War, it was popularly referred 
               to as the Avenue of Mortars because of the shells that ended up on the pavements and buildings. ´
               In 1981, during the Spanish Transition, the iconic street was dubbed Gran Vía. Throughout its long history, 
               Gran Vía has been home to Madrid’s first department stores and some of the best entertainment spots in the city.

            <h2><a href="https://www.timeout.com/madrid/museums/museo-del-prado" target="_blank">2. Museo del Prado (Prado museum)</a></h2>
            <p>Located in a spacious neo-classical building, the Prado is the most important art museum in Spain. 
               Its construction began with Juan de Villanueva by the commission of King Carlos III in 1785. In recent years, 
               the Prado has undergone a very ambitious expansion programme, and there’s a controversial new cube-shaped building, 
               designed by Rafael Moneo and mainly devoted to temporary exhibitions. Among the most notable works within the Prado 
               are ‘Las Meninas’ by Diego Velázquez, ‘The Third of May 1808’ by Francisco de Goya, and ‘The Garden of Earthly Delights’ 
               by Hieronymus Bosch (aka El Bosco).

            <h2><a href="https://www.patrimonionacional.es/visita/palacio-real-de-madrid" target="_blank">3. Palacio Real (Royal Palace)</a></h2> 
            <p>The residence of the Spanish monarchy from Carlos III to Alfonso XIII, this building now functions as a museum where 
                you can learn about the glitz and luxury of the Spanish royal elite. The architecture was inspired by sketches made 
                by Bernini to build the Louvre in Paris, and although Filippo Juvarra began working on the plans, it would be his protégé 
                Juan Bautista Sachetti who eventually finished the formidable job. The décor inside the 3,000 rooms was changed with each 
                shift in power to suit the specific tastes of each monarch. Our highlights include Sabatini's main staircase, the Throne Room, 
                the Royal Chapel, and the Royal Apothecary.

            <h2><a href="https://www.esmadrid.com/informacion-turistica/parque-del-retiro" target="_blank">4. El Retiro</a></h2>
            <p>This 118-hectare park dates back to the construction of the Monasterio de los Jerónimos by the order of 
                Catholic Monarchs. It’s one of the green spaces most used by locals in their leisure time. The park doesn't 
                just boast expansive lawns and well-manicured trees – you can check out monuments that remain from previous 
                centuries, including that of Alfonso XII, a colonnade work by José Grases Riera overlooking the pond; the 
                Casón del Buen Retiro, once majestic ballroom that’s now part of the Prado Museum; and the Palacio de Cristal, 
                built in 1887 for the Philippines Exposition. El Retiro’s gardens boast even more beauty, including a rose garden, 
                the Casa de Vacas cultural centre, and numerous fountains and statues, among which is the famous ‘Ángel Caído’ (‘Fallen Angel’) sculpture.

            <h2><a href="https://www.esmadrid.com/informacion-turistica/plaza-mayor-madrid" target="_blank">5. Plaza Mayor</a></h2>
            <p>You’ll find this iconic spot in the heart of the city’s historic district. Once home to the most popular market of 
                the late 15th century, these days the square is the headquarters of the Madrid Tourism Centre. The equestrian statue 
                of Felipe III in the centre of the square was designed by Giambologna and completed by Pietro Tacca in 1616. Another 
                important work in the area is the Arco de Cuchilleros, the most famous of the nine entrances to the square. The archway 
                is the work of Juan Villanueva, who, after the devastating fire of 1790, decided to reduce the façades by two levels, 
                close off the square, and raise the nine arches, so the largest in size with an enormous stairway would give passage to C/Cuchilleros.

            <h2><a href="https://www.museoreinasofia.es/" target="_blank">6. Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía</a></h2>
            <p>Don’t even think of leaving Madrid without a visit to this museum that, along with the Prado and the Thyssen Bornemisza, 
                forms part of Madrid’s Art Triangle. The Reina Sofía’s impressive façade features three lift towers of glass and steel 
                that give access to the largest contemporary art museum in the city. The extension on the back section was completed in 
                2005, adding 30,000 square metres, mainly used for temporary exhibition space. The masterpiece of this museum is without 
                question Pablo Picasso's ‘Guernica’, a painting commemorating the 1937 destruction of the Basque town of Guernica by German 
                bombers who flew in support of Franco’s forces during the Spanish Civil War.

            <h2><a href="https://www.esmadrid.com/informacion-turistica/puerta-de-alcala"target="_blank">7. Puerta de Alcalá</a></h2>
            <p>Located on a large roundabout in Plaza de la Independencia, this neoclassical passageway was one of the five ancient 
                entrances to the city. In fact, it got its name because it stands in the road that led to Alcalá de Henares. 
                Its appearance is similar to the triumphal arches built by the Romans, and it was designed by the Italian architect 
                Francesco Sabatini, who finished the construction in 1778. Since then, the statues, engravings and columns that decorate 
                the five arches have undergone five restorations. It’s currently doing splendidly and is one of the biggest tourist attractions 
                in Madrid. Our expert advice? Visit at night to admire its impressively illuminated fachade.

Temblo de Debod</a></h2>
            <p>This is the Nubian treasure of Madrid and the only Egyptian temple in Spain that is fully preserved. 
                Brought stone by stone from Egypt and carefully reconstructed with regard to its original orientation, this monument was a gift from Egypt 
                and UNESCO for Spain’s part in saving the Abu Simbel temples, which would have otherwise been submerged underwater after the construction of the Aswan 
                Dam. At the time of the dam’s construction, the temples comprised one of the most important pilgrimage destinations in Africa, dedicated to the gods 
                Amón and Isis with reliefs and carvings that decorate the inside of the sanctuary. When you visit, be sure to hang around to see the sunset, a 
                spectacular sight from where the temple stands.

            <h2><a href="https://www.esmadrid.com/informacion-turistica/puerta-del-sol" target="_blank">9. Puerta del Sol</a></h2>
            <p>The gate of the sun, or Puerta del Sol as it’s locally known, is located right in the very centre of Madrid. Named (unsurprisingly) 
                for the sunlight that shines down on the area, Puerta del Sol began as a broad crossing where small traders set up to do business 
                with those coming and going in the city center. Now, the most important building is the Casa de Correos, the government seat of 
                the Community of Madrid. The square is also home to one of the most famous statues in the city, ‘El Oso y el Madroño’ (‘The Bear 
                and the Strawberry Tree’), which stands 4 metres high, weighs 20 tonnes and is understandably always surrounded by tourists.

            <h2><a href="https://mercadodesanmiguel.es/" target="_blank">10. San Miguel Market</a></h2>
            <p>Here's a classic example of how a historic building in its later years bounced back to life, in this case, to become one of the most outstanding 
                gastronomic stops and tourist attractions in Madrid. In 2009 the Mercado de San Miguel was resurrected, with its original 1916 iron structure
                intact, and since then, the interior has housed a heady mixture of aromas, flavours and sensations for all tastes. This is buzzing life in 
                the heart of the Spanish capital, where you can always get an unforgettable meal.
