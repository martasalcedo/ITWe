        <p>The origins of Madrid date back to the pre-Roman period, when the area was nothing more than a rural region. The remains of a Visigoth basilica found on the current site of the Almudena Cathedral demonstrate the high probability of the presence of settlements.
            The first evidence of permanent settlements is during the Muslim era, with the construction of a defensive fortress next to the river. It is believed that the name of Madrid comes from said fortified Muslim settlement from the 9th century, called Mayrīţ.</p>

        <p>Madrid passed into Christian hands in 1085 and became part of the kingdom of Castile, prospering and receiving the title of town in 1123. The year 1561 is key for the history of Madrid, since Philip II moved the royal court, expanding its network of influence and pole of population attraction.
            The Plaza Mayor, one of the main spaces in Madrid, is one of the great projects of the reign of Felipe II.
            With the change of dynasty and the arrival of the Bourbons, Madrid experienced great improvements in its infrastructure and urban planning. During the reign of Philip V, the Royal Palace was built and with the arrival of the reign of Charles III, one of the main promoters of these reforms, Madrid was completely transformed.</p>
        <img src="../img/history3.jpg"></img>
        <p>The mission was to put it on par with the best European capitals. This is how the city was equipped with a sewage system, public lighting, parks, garbage collection, hospitals, and a better urban scheme.
            During his reign many of the great walks, avenues and monuments of Madrid were built. This is how the Paseo del Prado, the Retiro Park, the Puerta de Alcalá, the San Carlos Hospital (currently the Reina Sofía Museum) and the Prado Museum were built.
            The fountains of Cybele and Neptune were also built, two great icons of Madrid today.</p>
        <img src="../img/history4.jpg"></img>
        <p>The increase in population and the industrial era create the stage for the development of an urban plan. This is how the Ensanche or Castro Plan was created, an urban project that was carried out in the mid-19th century to solve the problems of a city that already reached 300,000 inhabitants by 1850.
            The plan took Puerta del Sol as its starting point and its mission was to decongest population density, improve train and tram communications, and create new neighborhoods. This is how new neighborhoods such as Salamanca or Chamberí emerge.</p>
        <img src="../img/history5.jpg"></img>
        <p>Madrid reached one million inhabitants with the arrival of the 20th century, a time when the expansions continued, where the bourgeoisie classes settled, and the suburbs, where the working classes lived.
            Among the major urban modifications, the Gran Vía was opened and the Madrid metro was inaugurated in 1919. After the end of the Civil War, Madrid received hundreds of thousands of inhabitants from the countryside, at the same time annexing new surrounding municipalities. By 1970, the city exceeded 3 million inhabitants.
            During the last century, large projects continued to arrive in Madrid. Between the 1950s and 2000s, renowned works were built such as the Plaza de España buildings, the Temple of Debod and the Puerta de Europa skyscrapers were inaugurated, to name a few.
            In the new millennium, Madrid continues to transform with places like Madrid Río or the skyscrapers of Cuatro Torres Business Area.</p>
